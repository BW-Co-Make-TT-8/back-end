To-do List:

Features that need to be added:
- Change all delete methods to clear the message body to "Deleted" and hide the username associated with the post and/or comment.
    - Comments that are attached to the deleted post and/or comment should not be deleted (cascade = off).
    - As a result, the post/comment that is "deleted" is not actually deleted but its attributes/fields are just wiped.
